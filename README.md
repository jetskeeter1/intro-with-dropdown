## My process

1st day - I create the skeleton and finished the nav bar which was quite simple, but left the technical part for later as I go finish the rest.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

In the main element I learned that it is great to use grid properties to get an even amount of size between two elements (Article and Picture) and then use 'place-item' to center the contents which gives me almost the right side white spaces.

I get to learn a little bit of the function or object method that would help me create and add height to the featurelist and companylist that I created that makes a responsive arrow up and down whenever I open and closed, at the same time added the height in javascript. The transition is added to the main list classes for company and feature to make the animation that I want.

### Continued development

I'll be using grid more often and experiment how I can size elements and placement because grid are very useful for placing each elements and it will resize itself by using grid template along with placing-items in center or arranging contents however I need to meet the client's needs

I'll continue to experiment more on dropdown and collapsing sidebars which is the most difficult problem I have ever encounter as I usually only cover simple html and css. And now I am ready to grow even more.

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com) - very usefull site to have whenever I end up forgetting something and it gives a quick explanations and examples how it works.

-[CSSTRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - very stylish, very informative, lots of tricksssss. very nice indeed. Anything CSS style related, will come here anytime for something new or cool tricks to learn, and has lost of images that shows examples.

-[GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybXulmeilFM) - this is a youtuber that I found that created the most simplest of drop down list using toggle and classlist in javascript. In CSS I create the .show class that will be used for the toggle

-[CodePen@RumitKuharSingh](https://codepen.io/rohitKumar/pen/azbBYo) - good code that I found to be quite useful, but I did change some to make it work with my dropdown list.
